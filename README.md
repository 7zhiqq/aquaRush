### Key Features:
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - View a list of all users with their roles and statuses.
  - Filter orders based on delivery status.
  - Add new orders and manage their status.
  
- **Staff & Cashier Dashboard**:
  - View orders and their statuses.
  - Filter orders by delivery status (Out for Delivery, Cancelled, Delivered).
  - Update order statuses, including marking orders as "Out for Delivery" or "Cancelled".
  
- **Driver Dashboard**:
  - View a list of orders assigned to the driver.
  - Update order status to "Delivered" when a delivery is completed.
  - View order details and the customer’s address.

- **Responsive User Interface**:
  - The application has a responsive design, which adapts for both desktop and mobile views.
  - Users can filter orders based on different delivery statuses.
  
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or higher
- MySQL (or an alternative database if preferred)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7zhiqq/aquaRush.git
   cd aquaRush
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   - Ensure MySQL is running on your system.
   - Create a MySQL database for the project:
   
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE aquaRush;
     ```

5. **Update Database Configuration**:
   - Open `settings.py` in your project and find the `DATABASES` configuration section.
   - Modify it to use MySQL, as shown below:
   
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'aquaRush',  # Database name
             'USER': 'root',      # MySQL username
             'PASSWORD': 'yourpassword',  # MySQL password
             'HOST': 'localhost',   # MySQL host
             'PORT': '3306',        # MySQL port
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Apply database migrations**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Create a superuser** (for the admin dashboard):

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to create the superuser account.

8. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your web browser to access the application.

### Configuration

1. **Settings for Roles and Permissions**:  
   - Admin users can view and manage all users and orders.
   - Staff and cashiers can update order statuses.
   - Drivers are assigned orders and can mark them as delivered.

2. **Database Configuration**:  
   - Ensure your MySQL database settings in `settings.py` are correct. For example:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'aquaRush',
             'USER': 'root',
             'PASSWORD': 'yourpassword',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '3306',
         }
     }
     ```

## Runtime Instructions

1. **Login as Admin**:
   - Admins can log in using the superuser credentials created during setup.
   - They will be able to create, see, and manage all users.

2. **Login as Staff or Cashier**:
   - Staff and cashiers can take and manage order statuses but cannot delete orders.
   - They can filter orders based on the delivery status and update them accordingly.

3. **Login as Driver**:
   - Drivers can view only the orders assigned to them.
   - They can mark orders as delivered once completed.

## Assumptions Made During Development

1. **Database**:
   - It is assumed that a MySQL database (or equivalent) is being used. Adjustments will be needed for other databases.
   
2. **User Roles**:
   - The system assumes a role-based user management structure where each user can be assigned specific roles like Admin, Cashier, Staff, or Driver.
   - Each role has specific permissions to access and modify the data.

3. **Frontend**:
   - The application uses basic Bootstrap 5 for styling and layout.
   - Some UI elements, such as buttons and dropdowns, are implemented using Font Awesome icons.

4. **Filters**:
   - Orders can be filtered by status in both the Admin and Driver dashboards.
   - The driver can only see their assigned orders based on their role.

## Troubleshooting

1. **MySQL connection issues**:
   - Ensure MySQL is running and that the database configuration in `settings.py` is correct.
   - If you encounter a `ConnectionError`, check the MySQL username, password, host, and port.
   
2. **Dependency issues**:
   - If you get an error related to missing dependencies, make sure you’ve run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and that all packages are installed.

3. **Migration issues**:
   - If migrations fail, ensure your database is created and accessible. You can manually apply migrations with:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
     ```
